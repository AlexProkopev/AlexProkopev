###

<p align="left">
I'm a junior <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. My name is Sasha.  
My IT journey began in <strong>2023</strong> with the <strong>FullStack course at GoIT</strong>, where I studied <strong>React + Node.js</strong>.  
During the course, I took part in several team pet projects.  
Since then, I’ve been improving my skills daily — coding, learning, and exploring best development practices.  
I work with a modern stack: <strong>JavaScript / React / Redux Toolkit / Node.js / MongoDB</strong>, building clean UIs and solid backends.
